# Hackathon-AdamProject

Welcome to KSU Hackathon 2021. 

Let's start by watching a short video about [Adam Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4XeZyTGEtc)

# Challenge
In the event of a report a missing child, it is important to make sure that child is protected from child offenders. The goal of the challenge is to:
- Identify all the offenders in and around the area that child was reported missing. - Given a route of travel/location, map potential offenders that might be targeting to meet the child 
- What can you infer from the missing kids repository about the hotspots for missing children? 
- Using ECL Visualizer to show result.

One way to approach this problem is to create a weight system based on the number of sex offenders and location approximately, let’s say 180 miles. Then map that to counties with missing children. Use the ECL visualization library to display the result.

# Challenge Datasets
For this challenge you have three datasets:
1-	GA missing kids report for Jan 2021
2-	Sex offenders registered in GA
3-	All US Cities/Counties lat, long, and fips points


# Challenge Tools

1.	HPCC Systems Data Lake System (Thor) for processing and analysis
2.	ECL language 
3.	ECL visualizer library

# Presentation Requirements
- Solution 
- How you approached the solution
- Code snippets 
- Visualizations
- Results
- Drawing conclusion


# Judging Criteria 
- All work should be done in ECL
- Presentation materials and skills 
- How the problem was approached and solved 

# Get Started 

Start with creating a login in [CloudIDE](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/).
User guide is available under Help in CloudIDE, also can be found in this repository.

[Adam_Workshop](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/02a3de01-58ae-4239-ac42-909d4628fee6) has the initial record layout and dataset code you need for this challenge. You can also find this code under AdamWorkshop folder in this repository.

## Quick ECL Tips

For a quick start on ECL syntax, please use [Learn ECL](https://hpccsystems-solutions-lab.github.io/). All sample code used in Learn ECL is available [LearnECL workshop](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/291d17d9-e5cb-4fac-83c2-ac5997c28a31) in CloudIDE.
